First repository, hello-world
My name is Michael Landstrom, I'm from Rock Island, Illinois. I've been working in the electronics industry for the last 12 years and am currently enrolled in online classes for web development. I'm also a muscian. I can sing, play guitar, bass guitar, drums, trumpet, piano, keyboards, harmonica, violin, and various percussion instruments. I have my own home recording studio, and write and recorded songs that I've written. I also play in a cover band called Machine Gun Willie.
